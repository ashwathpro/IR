1.Run the searchEngine.py 
$ python searchEngine.py 
2. A command prompt will open up. At any point type "help" or press TAB twice to get a list of all commands.
3. First run the "buildIndex" command (This command takes somewhere around 1 min 10 seconds to build all the three index variables ie, simpleIndex, positional index and kgram index)
4. run the "query" command and type in any query to find out the results. Repeat this "query" command any number of times to check for various inputs. Note: the query command will not work if the buildIndex is not previously run. Please finish step 3 before coming to step 4
5. to write out the index to a file "indexFile.txt" ,"posIndexFile.txt", "kgramIndexFile.txt" run the command "writeToFile" in the command prompt
6. Once you're done, run the "EOF" command to exit the program
